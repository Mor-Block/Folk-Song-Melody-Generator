# Folk-Song-Melody-Generator
Random Generation of Folk Music through a Corpus-Based Markov Model
The aim of this project is to generate folk melodies that are near-indistinguishable from composed melodies via a corpus-based computer model.
When given a substantial data-set of melodies to train upon, this script should be able to retun a melody that falls nicely between
completely random and derivative. Attatched to this project is a PDF which explains in much more detail what I can do here. This project 
began between myself, and Andrew Selle (atselle) during a doctoral seminar in computational analysis taught by Clifton Callender (cliftoncallender) while at Florida State University. This program utilizes Music21, and is only the beginning of something that could be much bigger.
