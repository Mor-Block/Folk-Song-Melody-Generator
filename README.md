# Folk-Song-Melody-Generator
Random Generation of Folk Music through a Corpus-Based Markov Model.

The aim of this project is to generate folk melodies that are near-indistinguishable from composed melodies via a corpus-based computer model.
When given a substantial data-set of melodies to train upon, this script should be able to retun a melody that falls nicely between
completely random and derivative. Attatched to this project is a PDF which explains in much more detail what I can do here. This project 
began between myself and Andrew Selle (@atselle) during a doctoral seminar in computational analysis instructed by Clifton Callender (@cliftoncallender) while at Florida State University. This program utilizes Python and Music21, and is still in its earlier stages.
